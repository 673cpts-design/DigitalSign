Problem Statement

How do we modernize old institutional processes to become more efficient with money and manpower while increasing positive public perception and employee morale?



Industry Answer

There's an app for that! Maybe you need multi-app solutions, each with a monthly subscription!



Industry Reality

Most apps are just webpages rendered by the web browser.



My Solution

Leverage the presentation power of the web browser to embed free to use web collaboration tools for ease of use to modify the contents behind a template of high level 
presentation. Running webpages in full screen kiosk mode gives the appearance of modern high-end apps because it is essentially the same thing as the front end of a 
commercial product.
